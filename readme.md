### Step1. Optical Pre-Process
We use [RAFT](https://github.com/princeton-vl/RAFT) to generate the optical flow in our data, you can either use our pre-processed optical flow (stored in []()) or generate them on you own by following steps:


Then place the generated optical flow file within .
### Step2. Relation-aware Refine Training

### Step3. PLA Training
